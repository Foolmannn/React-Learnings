// React Props Children
// Props Children
// In React, you can send the content between the opening and closing tags of a component, to another component.

// This can be accessed in the other component using the props.children property.


// Example
// From the Parent component, send the content between the opening and closing tags of the Son and Daughter components:

function Son(props) {
  return (
    <div style={{background: 'lightgreen'}}>
      <h2>Son</h2>
      <div>{props.children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

function Daughter(props) {
  const {brand, model} = props;
  return (
    <div style={{background: 'lightblue'}}>
      <h2>Daughter</h2>
      <div>{props.children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

function Parent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My two Children</h1>
      <Son>
        <p>
          This was written in the Parent component,
          but displayed as a part of the Son component
        </p>
      </Son>
      <Daughter>
        <p>
          This was written in the Parent component,
          but displayed as a part of the Daughter component
        </p>
      </Daughter>
    </div>
  );
}

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <Parent />
);
